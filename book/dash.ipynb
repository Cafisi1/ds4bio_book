    "# Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash is a framework for developing dashboards and creating web based data apps in R, python or Julia. Dash is more popular among the python focused, while shiny, a related platform, is more popular among R focused, but also applies much more broadly than just for R apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're focusing on python as our base language, we'll focus on dash. There's a wonderful set of tutorials [here](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction). Follow the instructions there on installation. We'll build a simple app here building on that tutorial. Let's take the first plotly example and use one of our examples.\n",
