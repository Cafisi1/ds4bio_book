    "# Python basics\n",
    "In this section, we will cover some basic python concepts. Python is an extremely quick language to learn, but like most programming languages, can take a long time to master. In this class, we'll focus on a different style of programming than typical software development, programming with data. This will but less of a burden on us to be expert software developers in python, but some amount of base language knowledge is unavoidable. So, let's get started learning some of the python programming basics. I'm going to assume you've programmed before in some language. If that isn't the case, consider starting with a basic programming course of study before trying this book.\n",

    "Some of the basic programming types in python are ints, floats, complex and Boolean.  The command `type` tells us which. Here's an example with 10 represented in 4 ways (int, float, string and complex)  and the logical value `True`. Note, we're using `print` to print out the result of the `type` command. If you're typing directly into the python command line (called the repl, for read, evaluate, print, loop), you won't need the print statements. But, if you're using a notebook you probably will.\n",
