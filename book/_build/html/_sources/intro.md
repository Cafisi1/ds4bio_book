# Welcome!

This is a book for the Data Science for Bio/Public Health/medical classes. 

## Markdown
Before getting started, you need to learn some markdown. Markdown is a markup language (like HTML) that is absurdly easy. Every data scientist needs to know markdown. Fortunately, you're five minutes away from knowing it. A markdown file is a text file that needs to be rendered to look nice. If you want an example, this page was written in markdown. To try it, go to google colab, create a markdown cell and start editing. [Try this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
