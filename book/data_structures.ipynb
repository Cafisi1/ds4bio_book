    "The topic of data structures focuses on how we represent, access and store data, ideally in ways efficient for our purpose. This chapter is a low level teaser of data structures geared towards students who haven't been exposed to the ideas much at all. \n",

    "## Hash tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A common starting point for data structures is a hash table. Suppose we want to store a set of `values` associated with a set of `keys`. Consider a list of some students and their PhD theses. \n",

    "If we stored these in an text array, say, and we wanted to look up Bruce's thesis title, we'd have to check each key in turn until we arived at Bruce and then looked up his thesis. This has a worst case scenario of n operations. (Question, if we looked in the order of a random permutation, what is the expected number of lookups?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables map the keys to a specific lookup number. Thus, when trying to find Bruce's value, the has function would perform `hash(\"Bruce\")` to get the hash value, then to straight to that point in the array. Sounds great!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some details, of course. Most (all) programming languages have hash tables, or libraries that add on hash tables. For example, the `dict` structure in python. Since that exists, let's work in R and create our own hash table. \n",

Ideally, you want you hash functions to have as few `collisions`, instances where different key texts give the same hash value, as possible. For our simple example, we're not going to stress out over this much and our hash function is going to give lots of collisions. Let's create an empty hash table"
