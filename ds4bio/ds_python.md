# Getting started

First, you'll need a place to program python for data analysis. Python has a dizzying array of options for its use. 
A first choice is whether you'll use python locally (installed on your computer) or in the cloud. The cloud options
take care of a lot of installation problems, in exchange for a loss in control and typically much less computing
resources unless you pay for stronger cloud computing. A second choice is whether you'll look program in notebook
environments or in a straight code editors. Notebooks mix code and documentation and are especially useful for
programming for data analyses. More pure code editors and integrated development environments are preferable for 
writing software.  Here's a list of some of things I've tried and liked.

* **Jupyter and Jupyter labs** These are the most popular notebook solutions for python. You can run them in the cloud or locally, since they run in a browser. There are hosted solutions and solutions that run in local virtual environments. 
* **google collaboratory** This is a cloud hosted solution that is about as easy as it gets and is really well done. Files can be stored on google drive. Really a wonderful way to get started in python and notebooks.
* **repl.it** a cloud IDE and repl for many languages, including python.  Great place to start learning python programming. 
* **paperspace** Paperspace has hosted jupyter notebooks where you can buy really powerful instances by the minute. It's super cost effective solution for running big jobs if you don't have local computing resources. Unlike a lot of other cloud providers, they are very beginner friendly. 
* **Anaconda** this is a front end to the conda virtual environment. Anaconda installs many python IDEs, including Jupyter, Jupyter Labs, Spyder, PyCharm, and virtual environments. 
* **emacs** I love emacs. It's an editor/IDE for lots of language. But has a steep learning curve. I use elpy in emacs (an add on). I'll only mention Vi, another editor, to mention that it exists.
* **vscode** A nice IDE for both notebooks and code development by Microsoft. It's free and cross platform. I particularly like how well it integrates with Windows Services for Linux.
* **spyder** and **pycharm** IDEs dedicated for python. I don't use these, but I've played around with them and can see why they're so popular. You can use them in Anaconda or install them natively.
* **atom**, **sublime**, **notepad++**, **eclipse**, ... these are editors and IDEs that are designed for many languages.
