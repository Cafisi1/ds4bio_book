# ds4bio_book
Files for the Data Science in Python for Biomedical Applications book.

The live version of the book is [here](https://smart-stats.github.io/ds4bio_book/book/_build/html/intro.html).

To set up the space to run this you need the requirements in `requirements.txt`

Note the vscode in codespaces on github required putting the book in a subdirectory? 
I think the culprit is jupyter-book was looking into the subdirectories.
